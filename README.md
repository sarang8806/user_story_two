2: Solve the problem of anomaly detection in CAN data 
2.1 Create the ROS node to perform anomaly detection which will take the data from the input node and output anomaly detection output on the publisher node. The anomaly to be detected in terms of valid data values for vehicle speed and status of vehicle doors open captured over CAN. At least, the window size of ‘N’ samples (‘N’ can be configurable parameter viz. 3, 5) to be considered before declaring the signal sequence as an anomaly.
